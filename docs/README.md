# Docs Overview

Welcome to the reference docs for the Cable Platform monorepo. Start with these quick paths:

- **Codespaces quickstart:** On first launch run `pnpm i && pnpm -w build` (already scripted in `.devcontainer`) then `pnpm -w run dev`.
- **API contracts:** `docs/api/` houses OpenAPI and validation notes.
- **Playbooks:** `docs/playbooks/` includes operational guides for incidents.
- **Testing:** See `docs/testing/` for multi-service integration scenarios.

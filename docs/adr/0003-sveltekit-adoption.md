# ADR 0003: SvelteKit Adoption

Date: 2025-10-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The platform requires a modern, full-stack frontend framework for the portal application. Key requirements include:

- Server-side rendering (SSR) for performance and SEO
- Component-based architecture
- TypeScript support
- Developer experience and productivity
- Integration with existing backend services
- Scalability and maintainability

The portal serves as the main user interface for cable platform operations, handling complex workflows for design, quoting, and project management.

Considered alternatives:
- Next.js (React-based)
- Nuxt.js (Vue-based)
- Traditional SPA frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- Vanilla JavaScript with minimal framework

## Decision

Adopt SvelteKit as the frontend framework for the portal application because:

1. **Superior performance**: Svelte's compile-time optimization and SvelteKit's SSR
2. **Developer experience**: Intuitive component syntax and built-in features
3. **Full-stack capabilities**: File-based routing, server-side rendering, API routes
4. **TypeScript integration**: First-class TypeScript support
5. **Small bundle size**: Minimal runtime overhead
6. **Modern tooling**: Vite-based build system, hot module replacement
7. **Ecosystem fit**: Good integration with existing Node.js/TypeScript stack

Key implementation decisions:
- Use SvelteKit's file-based routing system
- Implement server-side rendering for initial page loads
- Use Svelte stores for client-side state management
- Integrate with existing authentication and API services
- Maintain component library consistency

## Consequences

### Positive
- Excellent runtime performance and user experience
- Reduced bundle sizes and faster load times
- Improved SEO through server-side rendering
- Enhanced developer productivity and code maintainability
- Strong TypeScript integration reducing runtime errors
- Future-proof architecture with modern web standards

### Negative
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Svelte
- Smaller ecosystem compared to React/Next.js
- Potential vendor lock-in to Svelte ecosystem
- Migration effort from any existing frontend code

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Adoption challenges**: Comprehensive training and documentation
- **Ecosystem limitations**: Evaluate critical dependencies and community support
- **Migration complexity**: Phased migration approach with feature flags
- **Performance expectations**: Realistic benchmarking against requirements
